# TODO

## Product & UX
- Map end-to-end experience for individual chats, screening cadence, shared summaries, and escalation.
- Define information architecture for partner linking, private reflection, shared understanding, and group chat.
- Draft privacy/consent flows with clear non-clinical disclaimers.
- Create low-fidelity wireframes for chat, screening, summary, and escalation entry points.

## Content & Behavioral Design
- Write non-judgmental prompt library for individual reflection during pregnancy/postpartum.
- Define shared emotional framework terminology and glossary for summaries.
- Establish language guidelines to avoid diagnosis or prescriptive advice.
- Draft AI counselor facilitation scripts for group chat alignment.

## Data, Safety, and Risk
- Select screening instrument(s) and cadence; document non-diagnostic interpretation rules.
- Define longitudinal risk thresholds and escalation triggers.
- Specify privacy, consent, and access control requirements.
- Create safety review checklist and red-team scenarios for language risks.

## Engineering (MVP)
- Implement auth and partner linking.
- Build private chat flows for each partner with secure storage.
- Add screening scheduler, delivery, and longitudinal tracking.
- Generate shared interpretive summaries (understanding, not advice).
- Implement risk detection and escalation to AI counselor group chat.
- Create therapist access pathway for triggered sessions.

## Pilot & Validation
- Recruit 5–10 couples and 1–2 therapists for a 4–6 week pilot.
- Define pilot metrics: screening adherence, clarity/misalignment scores, escalation latency.
- Run pilot, collect feedback, and iterate on safety, content, and UX.
