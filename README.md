> An AI-powered counseling system that helps couples build shared emotional understanding during pregnancy and postpartum.

## 🎯 Overview

MocchiLogic provides a web-based platform for couples experiencing emotional and psychological changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period. By combining individual reflection spaces, regular mental health screening, and AI-facilitated group conversations, the system helps partners interpret emotional changes together—reducing misunderstanding and relationship strain.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Private Individual Reflection** – Each partner has a secure, confidential chat space for emotional processing with empathetic AI guidance
- **📊 Regular Depression Screening** – EPDS-based assessments monitor emotional well-being over time (non-diagnostic)
- **🤝 Shared Understanding Framework** – Neutral summaries help couples interpret emotional changes with a common language
- **🚨 Smart Escalation** – Risk detection triggers AI counselor-facilitated group conversations when support is needed
- **🔐 Privacy-First Design** – Private chats remain private; only consensually shared summaries enter group discussions
- **🎙️ Voice Output** – Text-to-speech support for key AI responses

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

### The Problem
During pregnancy and postpartum, emotional changes are often misinterpreted as:
- Lack of love or effort
- Personal failure
- Relationship breakdown

This confusion amplifies conflict during an already vulnerable period, yet couples lack shared frameworks to understand these changes together.

### The Solution
MocchiLogic creates **interpretation before reaction**—helping both partners understand the same emotional reality at the same time, without diagnosis, prescription, or judgment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system operates through three integrated flows:

1. **Individual Counseling** – Private AI chat sessions with contextualized, non-judgmental prompts
2. **Screening & Monitoring** – Regular EPDS surveys with intelligent risk flagging
3. **Guided Group Conversations** – AI counselor-led couple discussions focused on present-moment alignment

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

**This system is NOT:**
- A diagnostic or clinical treatment tool
- A replacement for professional therapy or medical care
- An emergency or crisis intervention service
- Designed to resolve deep or pre-existing relationship dysfunction

**This system IS:**

- A neutral, non-judgmental space for reflection and alignment

## 🔐 Privacy & Safety

- All interactions use non-clinical, emotionally safe language
- Private chats remain completely confidential
- Group chats require explicit consent from both partners
- Only neutral, consensually shared summaries enter group discussions
- No prescriptive advice—output is understanding, not action plans

## 🎓 Core Principles

1. **Understanding over fixing** – We reduce confusion about emotions, not emotions themselves
2. **Shared frameworks** – Both partners interpret changes using the same mental models
3. **Prevention over reaction** – Clarity before conflict, alignment before crisis
4. **Privacy and neutrality** – Safe spaces with zero judgment
5. **Empowerment over prescription** – Users maintain agency and autonomy

## 📊 Success Metrics

- Partners report clearer mutual understanding (>75% positive feedback)
- Regular screening completion by both partners (>70% adherence)
- Faster recovery of shared understanding after misalignment (30% improvement)
- Reliable escalation to supported conversations with privacy upheld
